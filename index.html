                  looking at elgibility and guiding them with example schedules
                  for future semesters to satisfy any given courses. This was
                  able to be done by employing priority queues, linkedlists, and
                  hash tables to find courses and to align with the Rutgers
                  Computer Science structure. Along with the continued

                  structures.

        <p>I have always been someone who has been very interested in learning about business and what insights are made to make improved analytical decisions. Computer Science was something that I never expected to be pursuing and enjoying. One of the core reasons I chose it as a major was because of how much enthusiasm my dad always taught me, concepts and languages like C and SQL with. Being someone I look up to and consistently compete with, some of my passion for Computer Science definitely comes from my drive to push past my dad. I am a sophomore at Rutgers Business School pursuing a degree in BAIT and Computer Science. These majors , CS and BAIT, really stood out to me because of my career interests in aspects including solving business challenges and software engineering. The languages I am well adapted to are C, Java, Python, HTML/CSS, and SQL. My current goal is to gather more entry-level experience in these areas through career opportunities. Some other things I enjoy doing are playing basketball, watching the New York Jets, learning about cars and facing unforeseen challenges. </p>
